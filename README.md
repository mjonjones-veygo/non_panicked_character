## Description
This package contains some utility functions with default values
to generate attributes of npcs (Non-Playable-Characters).

I've often found myself having to come up with characters on the
fly and thought something simple like this would help.

Yes, the code here isn't fantastic and could definitley be
improved. You could even say it's pointless. But the point of this
project was to allow me to play around with python packaging,
semantic release, poetry and github actions.

Hoping I can come back to this at some and actually make a better
NPC-generator that isn't just "the same function that returns a
random element from an array, but has different default values".
